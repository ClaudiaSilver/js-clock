CSS and Javascript clock (Project No. 2 in Wes Bos's Javascript 30 course)

I made the following changes / additions:
* styled the clock hands for better UX
* fixed glitch: added an if statement to skip the transitions when the hands hit 12 o'clock
* created an object and function to change the background image based on time of day
